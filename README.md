### Copyright Image Protection | Digital Signal Processing, MATLAB| 

-	Converted a colour image to grayscale and resized it to 256x256 pixels for standardization.
-	Embedded a unique watermark using a randomly generated number for secure identification.
-	Applied DSP techniques to encode and decode the watermark.
-	Evaluated image quality using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to ensure minimal distortion and verify watermark integrity.
-	Implemented robust security measures to prevent hacking.
